# PLC Based self Car-washing Plant with automatic and manual operation

The main idea of the project is to provide water, shampoo/foam, and wax to the users based on tariff during their self car washing. Users could select the manual or automatic mode for washing item selection.

**Manual Mode:**  In manual mode, users could have the option to choose either plain water or Shamoo or wax for washing the car.

**Automatic Mode:** In automatic mode, users will get plain water in the first cycle, shampoo/foam in the second cycle, and finally wax in the last cycle.
